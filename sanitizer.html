				<h1>How to Make a Sanitizer</h1><br>
	<p>Hand sanitizers play a huge role in preventing the spread of germs through hands. Use a hand sanitizer when you can't use soap and water in the foreseeable future. According to the CDC, not all hand sanitizers can be used against COVID-19 because only the hand sanitizers which have 60-95% alcohol concentration are effective to kill the germs. An alcohol based hand sanitizer can immediately attack the cell structure of the virus, making it impossible to infect anyone.</p><br><br><b>Procedure For a Homemade Hand Sanitizer</b><br><br><p>1. Take a sterile and empty bowl where you can make the sanitizer.<br>2. Add 1/2 cup of 72% rubbing alcohol to the bowl, which is used to alter the proteins of the virus, neutralizing it and making the virus ineffective.<br>3. One teaspoon of 98% pure glycerin, which is used to make the sanitizer evaporate slower, making it more effective.<br>4. Add 4 teaspoons of aloe vera gel, which is used to provide moisture and nourishment for the skin.<br>5. This step is optional, but if you have essential oil, then you can add about 5 drops of it for the fragrance.<br>6. Mix well until thoroughly combined.<br>7. Add the sanitizer to an empty bottle. Your sanitizer is now done!<br></p><br><iframe width="956" height="538" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3pqXW3E6Kb4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br><b>References</b><br><p><a href="https://www.indushealthplus.com/can-sanitizer-prevent-the-spread-of-coronavirus.html">Can Hand Sanitizer Prevent Spread of Coronavirus Infection</a></p><p><a href="https://www.indushealthplus.com/how-sanitizer-kills-germs-viruses-effectively.html">How Sanitizer Kills Germs and Viruses Like Covid-19 Effectively</a></p><p><a href="https://fmolhs.org/coronavirus/coronavirus-blogs/how-to-make-homemade-hand-sanitizer">How To Make Homemade Hand Sanitizer</a></p><p><a href="How to make Hand Sanitizer at Home using W.H.O formula(World Health Organisation) Easy Steps, DIY">How to make Hand Sanitizer at Home using W.H.O formula(World Health Organisation) Easy Steps, DIY</a></p>
