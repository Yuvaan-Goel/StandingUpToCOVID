				<h1>Sterilization Robots</h1><br>
	<container>
	<p>Nowadays, it can be very challenging and even a life-threatning task to clean hospital rooms as there are so many people there. To save their staffs, some hospitals are using sterilization robots to clean places inside the hospital. One of the most effective types of disinfection robots is the HELIOS UV robot.</p><br><b>The HELIOS UV Robot</b><p>THE HELIOS UV disinfection and sterilization robot kills germs in the environment by decomposing their DNA structures, thus preventing and reducing the spread of viruses, bacteria and other harmful microorganisms. It is able to move autonomously for timed, fixed-point and multi-track mobile disinfection and sterilization in large areas.
<br><br>
The robot has two working modes:
Mode 1: Air circulating sterilization and disinfection. The sterilization and disinfection is equipped with high-power UV lamps. Air flows into the UV sterilization channel through the purification and circulation system. The robot is capable of killing microorganisms in the air, such as fungi, bacteria, and viruses, and has significant effects on harmful microorganisms in aerosols and the like.
<br><br>
Mode 2: UV sterilization and disinfection. The robot is turned on in an unmanned state through infrared induction, and the sterilization and disinfection centre will emit the condensed UV beams to kill bacteria and other harmful microorganisms, thus preventing cross infection in high-risk areas and purifying the air.

The robots consist of a mobile base equipped with multiple lidar sensors and an array of powerful short wavelength ultraviolet-C (UVC) lights.

The operator deploys the robot using a computer. The robot scans the environment with lidars and creates a digital map. The operator can then annotate the map indicating all the rooms and points the robot should not disinfect. After that, the robot relies on simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) to navigate.

The autonomous robots can enter a room and disinfect it with UV-C light without exposing staffers to potentially harmful radiation. It takes between 10 and 15 minutes to disinfect a typical hospital room, with the robot spending one or two minutes in five or six different positions around the room to maximize the number of surfaces that it disinfects. The robot’s UV array emits 20 joules per square meter per second of 254-nanometer light at 1 meter distance, which will destroy 99.99 percent of germs.
</p><br><img src="uvd_robotics_web.jpg"><br><br><br><b>Finsen Technologies</b><p>The THOR UVC is a high-output UV disinfection robot using unique room mapping technology allowing the operator to position the robot in the optimum location to deliver a fast and effective germicidal dose of continuous wave UVC energy killing germs and pathogens. It works on the principles of the Inverse Square Law – and delivers more UVC power output over a longer distance, killing more germs in the quickest time – getting that area thoroughly disinfected.

The robot can be adjusted for any height between 1.1 m and 2.25 m, covering floor to ceiling and eliminating shadows, for more thorough disinfection. Its ergonomic handrail and unique 6 caster wheel design make it easy to move from room to room for fast and efficient room turnaround.
